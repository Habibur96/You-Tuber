                        <b>Authentication</b>
                        <p>1. Authentication verifies who the user is. <br />
                            2. Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user. <br />
                            3. Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process.</p>
                        <b>Authorization</b>
                        <p>1. Authorization determines what resources a user can access. <br />
                            2. Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user. <br />
                            3. Authorization always takes place after authentication.</p>

                        <p>Firebase Authentication aims to make building secure authentication systems easy, while improving the sign-in and onboarding experience for end users. It provides an end-to-end identity solution, supporting email and password accounts, phone auth, and Google, Twitter, Facebook, and GitHub login, and more. <br /> <br /> Usually, authentication by a server entails the use of a user name and password. Other ways to authenticate can be through <b>cards, retina scans, voice recognition, and fingerprints.</b> </p>
